Load X1 buffer (RM0440 pg. 494)
This function pre-loads the X1 buffer with N values, starting from the address in X1_BASE.
Successive writes to the FMAC_WDATA register load the write data into the X1 buffer and
increment the write address. The write pointer points to the address X1_BASE + N when the
function completes.
== check detail of the function how it writes successively.

Load X2 buffer (RM0440 pg 495)
This function pre-loads the X2 buffer with N + M values, starting from the address in
X2_BASE. Successive writes to the FMAC_WDATA register load the write data into the X2
buffer and increment the write address.
== check detail of the function how it writes successively.
